# Tidy Modeling with R - Code Repository

This repository contains code examples, exercises, and projects inspired by the book [*Tidy Modeling with R*](https://www.tmwr.org/) by **Max Kuhn** and **Julia Silge**. The book introduces the `tidymodels` framework for building, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models in R using a tidyverse-friendly workflow.

## 📖 **About the Book**
[*Tidy Modeling with R*](https://www.tmwr.org/) explores modern machine learning practices using the `tidymodels` ecosystem. The book covers:
- Data preprocessing with `recipes`
- Building models with `parsnip`
- Hyperparameter tuning with `tune`
- Model evaluation with `yardstick`
- Workflows for reproducible machine learning

This repository is my personal implementation of the book's concepts, exercises, and projects.
